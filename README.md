&emsp;&emsp; 大三就读物理专业，起步凝聚态理论方向研究。目前在看近藤输运问题以及多费米子Ring Exchange问题，并尝试利用Itensor模拟。将文献阅读的部分心得上传于此，以供参考与批判。

&emsp;&emsp; In my junior year, I majored in physics and started researching in the direction of condensed matter theory. Currently I'm looking at the Kondo transportation problem and the multi-fermion Ring Exchange problem, and trying to simulate it via Itensor. Some of the experience of reading the related papers is uploaded here for reference and criticism.
